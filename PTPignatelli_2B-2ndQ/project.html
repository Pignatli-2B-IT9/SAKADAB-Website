<h4>Problem Identification<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
<small>Assigned - Gabrielle</small>
</div>
</div>
<p>The issue that our project aims to address is the lack of exposure and financial support. 
Since gaining profit wasn't regular for the organization, the lack of funds, financial problems 
arise, and the needs of the beneficiaries such as medicine, and food are not always met which 
may eventually affect their health if not appropriately addressed. These issues interfere with 
their ability to strive for and achieve sustainability, which has an impact on their daily lives.

<h4>Project significance<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
<small>Assigned - Robb</small>
</div>
</div>
<p>Promoting the organization and this project will be effective for them to gain more audience, 
they will get the attention that they need and hopefully, we can help them generate more funds 
to sustain their organization. Social media is a venue that can easily reach a lot of people and 
a lot of sectors who are interested in helping with such projects. It could happen if there is 
cooperation between the people behind the organization as well as the students who are willing 
to help them. They should work together to make it possible and for it to be successful.

<h4>Project proposal<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
<small>Assigned - Tabbu</small>
</div>
</div>
<p>To solve the problem, we can create more projects that will showcase the products made by the 
organization. Apparently, they have products that they personally made and we can find ways to 
advertise these products so that more people will be aware of them and come to support the organization. 
For instance, having some models (not necessarily well-known models, but willing students or members 
of the institution that are willing to model) use these items and demonstrate their potential, good 
quality, beauty, and use then posting it in the different social media official accounts of SAKADAB.

<h4>Project Background<i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
<small>Assigned - Hainie</small>
</div>
</div>
<p>Every single organization or institution mostly gains their income through the donations 
of the public to continue what they are doing therefore theoretically speaking it has existed 
ever since the first organization existed because every single institution's main way of 
gaining money is through the donations of the public as stated above. The identified problem 
is the lack of acknowledgement and financial support. The objective of our partner organization 
is to one day enable the beneficiaries to thrive and live independently and happily in 
the outside world. Money will of course be something essential in order to achieve this goal. 
With more people acknowledging the institution, their goal, history, as well as capabilities, 
more will also be more willing to support them through donations, proposed projects to help them 
achieve the goal, like what we are doing right now, and purchasing the products they are selling.
